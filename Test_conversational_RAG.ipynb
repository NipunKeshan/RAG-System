Your approach should be rooted in Socratic questioning, prompting students to think critically and come to conclusions on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Instructions:\n",
    "# 1. **Engage before answering**: No matter what the student's first message is (whether a greeting, question, or request), your first response must always be: \n",
    "#     - 'Before we dive into that, could you enter your name and hobby? This will help me personalize your learning experience!'\n",
    "#     - Only after the student provides their name and hobby should you continue with the conversation. This ensures that the interaction is personalized and context-aware.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 2. **Personalized Learning**: \n",
    "#     - Use the student’s name once provided, and tailor your responses to align with their interests or hobbies. If they mention a hobby, find ways to weave it into your explanations to make the learning more relatable.\n",
    "#     - For example, if a student likes gaming, you might relate database concepts to game mechanics, or if a student enjoys sports, relate programming to sports analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Encourage Critical Thinking**: \n",
    "#     - Whenever the student asks a question, **never** give a direct answer immediately. Instead, **ask probing questions** that guide them toward the answer. For example:\n",
    "#         - \"What do you think would happen if you approached this differently?\"\n",
    "#         - \"How might this concept apply to something you’ve already learned?\"\n",
    "#     - This encourages students to think through problems themselves, reinforcing their learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Handling Greetings and Small Talk**: \n",
    "#     - If the student greets you or engages in casual conversation, respond warmly and guide the conversation back to learning. For example:\n",
    "#         - \"Hello! Great to meet you! What would you like to explore today?\"\n",
    "#     - If they greet you and provide their name and hobby, continue with personalized learning, such as:\n",
    "#         - \"Hi [Student Name]! Awesome to know you enjoy [Hobby]. Let's dive into learning! What are you curious about today?\"\n",
    "#     - Encourage the student to share what they are interested in learning, and use that as a springboard for deeper conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. **Addressing Confusion**: \n",
    "#     - If a student expresses confusion or seems uncertain about a concept, **never** just restate the concept. Instead, ask reflective questions like:\n",
    "#         - \"What part of this concept is unclear to you?\"\n",
    "#         - \"Can you think of a real-world example where this might apply?\"\n",
    "#     - Encourage them to break down the problem themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. **Handling Complex Questions**: \n",
    "#     - If a student asks a complex or multi-faceted question, **break the question down into smaller parts** and address each part one by one. This will make the information more digestible.\n",
    "#     - Encourage the student to think through the question and explain their understanding of each part before providing guidance.\n",
    "#     - For example: \"Let's break this down. First, what do you understand by this term?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. **Contextual Understanding**: \n",
    "#     - Always keep the context of the conversation in mind. If the student is discussing a topic in programming, refer back to previous topics they’ve mentioned to help connect the dots.\n",

    "#     - Your primary tool is **deep-seek reasoning**. Instead of answering directly, always prompt the student to explore the material more deeply.\n",

       "'\\n\\nCertainly! Let’s break down the concept of **proper probability** step by step.\\n\\n### 1. **Understanding Probability**\\nProbability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where:\\n- A probability of **0** means the event is impossible.\\n- A probability of **1** means the event is certain.\\n- A probability between **0** and **1** indicates some degree of uncertainty.\\n\\n### 2. **The Law of Large Numbers**\\nOne key aspect of proper probability is the law of large numbers, which states that as the number of trials or observations increases, the relative frequency of an event tends to approach its theoretical probability.\\n\\nFor example:\\n- If you flip a fair coin many times (e.g., 100 times), the proportion of heads will likely be close to 50%.\\n- If you roll a six-sided die many times, the proportion of each number rolled should be roughly **1/6**.\\n\\n### 3. **Assigning Probabilities**\\nProper probability involves assigning probabilities in a way that is consistent and logical:\\n- **Equal Probability**: Assign equal probability to all possible outcomes when there is no reason for them to differ.\\n  - Example: If you have a fair six-sided die, each number (1–6) has an equal chance of being rolled. Thus, the probability of rolling any specific number is **1/6**.\\n- ** unfair Probability**: Assign probabilities based on inherent characteristics or fairness.\\n  - Example: A loaded die that tends to roll a \"6\" more often than other numbers would have a higher probability assigned to rolling a \"6\".\\n\\n### 4. **Proper vs. Improper Probability**\\nWhen assigning probabilities, it is proper if:\\n- The assignment reflects the true nature of the situation.\\n- Probabilities are consistent with each other.\\n- They do not contradict known facts or logical expectations.\\n\\nImproper probability might involve:\\n- Unjustified assumptions (e.g., \"There’s a 50% chance of rain today\").\\n- Overlooking the fairness of an event (e.g., assigning equal probability to heads and tails in a biased coin).\\n- Failing to ensure that probabilities sum to **1** or **100%**.\\n\\n### 5. **Examples**\\n#### Example 1: Coin Flip\\n- Possible outcomes: Heads (H) and Tails (T).\\n- Since the coin is fair, each outcome has an equal probability of **0.5**.\\n- **Probability of H**: 0.5\\n- **Probability of T**: 0.5\\n\\n#### Example 2: Card Probability\\n- Possible outcomes: Any one of the 52 cards in a standard deck.\\n- If you want to assign probabilities based on suit:\\n  - Each suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) has an equal probability of **1/4** or **0.25**.\\n\\n#### Example 3: Weather Forecast\\n- Possible outcomes: Rain or No Rain.\\n- If the weather forecast assigns a **0.5** probability to rain:\\n  - It assumes that both outcomes are equally likely, which may not always be accurate.\\n  - A better approach would be to consider historical data and current conditions.\\n\\n### 6. **Real-World Applications**\\nProper probability is used in various fields, including statistics, finance, and science:\\n- **Finance**: Assigning probabilities to market movements or investment outcomes based on historical patterns.\\n- **Statistics**: Using probability distributions (e.g., normal distribution) to model real-world phenomena.\\n- **Quality Control**: Assigning probabilities to product defects based on sample testing.\\n\\n### 7. **Proper vs. Improper in Practice**\\nWhen assigning probabilities:\\n- You should consider the context and any known biases or fairness of the situation.\\n- Ensure that your probability assignments are consistent with each other and logical with the broader framework.\\n- Avoid making unwarranted assumptions or overgeneralizations.\\n\\nIn summary, proper probability involves logically and consistently assigning probabilities based on the nature of the situation, ensuring they reflect truth, fairness, and consistency.'"

      "What is normalization?\n",
      "\n",
      "Normalization is a key concept in database design that aims to reduce redundancy by eliminating duplicate entries from primary keys. It ensures that each piece of data is stored in only one record, which improves data integrity and query efficiency. This process helps maintain consistency and clarity across the entire system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you think of an example where normalization might be applied? For instance, how could normalization help manage a database for a library?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure! Let's say we have a database that stores books with fields like title, author, publication year, genre, and checkouts. In this case, the primary key would likely be the book ID. However, there may also be other duplicate entries if multiple instances of the same book exist in different copies or formats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normalization would help us identify redundant data by grouping related records together. For example, books with the same title but different publication years could form a separate group to manage their unique characteristics. Similarly, genre information can be grouped together since they belong to the same category within the library system.\n",
      "\n",
      "By normalizing this database, we ensure that each field contains a single value and that relationships are well-defined. This helps in reducing the risk of errors during data entry and ensures that queries perform efficiently when executed later on the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normalization is also essential for identifying duplicates early in the design phase. When we encounter duplicate entries or inconsistencies in our system design, normalization can help us address these issues before proceeding with the actual implementation. It acts as a safeguard against potential problems down the line by ensuring data integrity and consistency throughout the entire process.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, normalization is crucial for designing robust and efficient database systems that maintain data integrity and performance while eliminating redundancy and inconsistencies.\n",
